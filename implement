** Implement Specifications **

Playing minion

1. Card is removed from hand and mana cost is deducted
2. On play phase -- 'play_card' event is alerted.
   Wat for play_card event to be resolved. Then, it calls spawn_card()
3. Battlecry phase -- on_spawn() of played card is called
   When everything is resolved that is created through battlecry of minion,
   end_spawn_card() is called
   (** on_spawn function takes end_spawn_card as a callback so that it can immediately
   call end_spawn_card() as it finishes card spanwing. However, end_spawn_card postpones
   alerting 'spawn' Event until everything is resolved)
4. 'spawn' Event is alerted.
